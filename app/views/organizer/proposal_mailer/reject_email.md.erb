    Hello,

    Thank you for your submission to RedDotRubyConf 2016's Call for Proposal.

    Our program committee received many great talk submissions this year, and that's allowed us to put together an exciting program.

    As a result of the number of talks submitted, however, we've had to turn down a lot of excellent proposals.
    I'm sorry to say that we were not able to accept your submission titled, "<%= @proposal.title %>", this year.
    This is always the toughest part knowing that we simply can't fit all the good talks in.

    Nevertheless, we still hope to see you at this year's conference and as promised, we have reserved ticket space for you.
    Please use this discount code: "CFP-PARTICIPANT" to enjoy Super Early Bird rate at SGD 255.

    Thank you once again for your submission as we really appreciate your willingness to share with the community.

    Cheers,
    Winston

    Organiser, RedDotRubyConf
